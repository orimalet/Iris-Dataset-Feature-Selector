# Iris-Dataset-Feature-Selector
Python Programme for Applied AI assignment-1


For the setosa vs. versicolor learning problem, assume that the
perceptron training must choose 3 (i.e. no more, no less) out of the 4
Iris features in the perceptron learning procedure. As such, one
feature must be left out. If the perceptron learning is performed for 4
iterations, which feature should be left out after 4 iterations?


Recall that the retrieved Iris dataset is organised such that the first 50
records depict one class, and so on until the third class.

Recall that setosa and versicolor are the first two classes.

Since the total number of features is small, one can try the four
combinations of all features except one.
